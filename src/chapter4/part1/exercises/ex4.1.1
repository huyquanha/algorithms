- Maximum number of edges (no parallel edges): V(V-1)/2

- Minimum number of edges so that no vertex is isolated (don't have any edge incident to it)
    - if V is even, we connect each 2 vertices together => V/2 edges
    - if V is odd, we do the same and there will be 1 vertex with no edges incident to it
    => we connect it with one other vertex using 1 edge => V/2 + 1
