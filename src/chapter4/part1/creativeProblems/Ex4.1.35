Given a pair of vertices s and t, since the graph has no articulation points, if we remove any vertex
on the path that connects s and t, the graph is still connected, that is, there's still a way to get from s to t.

Now, after we remove that vertex and its adjacent edges, the path that we used previously to connect s and t
will no longer work, but since the graph is still connected => there must be another path that is disjoint from
the previous path that connects s and t => the graph is biconnected
