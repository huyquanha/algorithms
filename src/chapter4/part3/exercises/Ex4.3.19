Prim's algorithm uses an index priority queue to store the shortest edge weight discovered so far to each vertex,
sorted by vertex
- Each vertex will be inserted and then deleted from the priority queue, and in the worst case there will be
E changes to edge to each vertex
- Since the size of the priority queue is V => VlogV + ElogV ~ ElogV

Kruskal's algorithm uses ElogE in the worst case because it inserts all the edges and the remove them
