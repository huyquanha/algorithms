It's easy to see why without even finding a counter-example: the min-weight edge that is incident to the most recently
added vertex might be larger than one of the already-discovered edges from another vertex in the MST to the destination vertex

That's why it's important to maintain a priority queue of all edges ordered by weight, or to maintain the min-weight edge
from the tree to a non-tree vertex, not just considering the new edges of the most recently added vertex
