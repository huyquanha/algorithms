By contradiction, let's say the maximum weight in the cycle belongs to the MST. Let's call it e

That means, one of the other edges in the cycle must not be in the MST, otherwise we would have a cycle. Let's call it f

However, we can see that by removing e and adding f to the MST, since weight(f) < weight(e) it would result in a smaller weight MST
=> contradict with the fact that MST weight is minimal
=> the maximum weight in the cycle would not be in the MST
