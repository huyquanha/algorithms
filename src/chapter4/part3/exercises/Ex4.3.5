When edge weights are not distinct, for each cut we might have more than one minimum-weight crossing edge.
With greedy algorithm, we can choose any of them, it just results in different MST but the weight should still be minimum.
We can use the same proof we use to prove that the minimum-weight crossing edge must be in the MST to prove that it doesn't
make a difference which edge we choose, out of those minimum-weight edges
