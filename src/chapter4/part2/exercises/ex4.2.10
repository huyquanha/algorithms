Topological Order: 0 1 2 3 4

DFS cannot produce this topological order, because it will go all the way down the tree first until it reach the bottom,
so 4 will always be immediately after 1, no matter the order the vertices are visited from 0. It's not possible for 4
to be separated from 1 by 2 and 3.
