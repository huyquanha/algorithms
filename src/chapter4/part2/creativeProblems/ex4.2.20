2 things to prove
- If G is connected and each vertex has equal in-degree and out-degree => G has an Eulerian cycle (1)
- If G has an Eulerian cycle => it is connected and each vertex has equal in-degree and out-degree (2)

To prove (1)
- G is connected => there exists a path from v to w and another one from w to v => there exists a cycle in G
- We want to prove that there exists a cycle in G that
    - go through every edge
        - By contradiction, let's assume the cycle doesn't use all the edges. However the cycle is guaranteed to use
        the same number of indegree and outdegree since it goes in and out of the vertex => the remaining un-traversed
        in-degree and out-degree of a vertex will be the same => we can keep going out and in of that vertex until we consume
        all the degree => it's possible for us to have a cycle that use all the edges.
    - each edge is only used once
        - this is also possible by the previous prove.

To prove (2)
- Supposed by contradiction G is not connected => there exists a pair of vertices v and w such that there is a path
from v to w but no path from w back to v. This contradicts with the fact that G has a Eulerian cycle which visits each edge
exactly once, because we couldn't get from v to w then back to v => G must be connected
- Since each edge is only traversed once, it's essential that each vertex has the same number of in-degree (edges pointing to
the vertex) and number of out-degree (edges pointing from the vertex). Since we have a cycle, the path doesn't end at any vertex
=> it has to go in and then out of any vertex. To be able to traverse each edge exactly once, the number of ways to go in and
the number of ways to go out of a vertex must be the same.
