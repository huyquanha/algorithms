We prove by a counter-example:

A -> B
A -> C
B -> C

Let's say we start the traversal from A
- if we use DFS
    - if we visit B first, DFS will visit C next and push to stack, then B and finally A => order is A B C => topological
    - if we visit C first, C done and pushed to stack. We then visit B and check C but C marked => B done => pushed to stack and then A
    => also topological order A B C

- if we use BFS
    - we will visit both B and C and mark them as having a distance of 1 from A. Our toplogical order could be correct (A B C)
    but could also be incorrect (A C B) (incorect because there's an edge from B to C => B has to be done before C). => BFS is
    not reliable
