For every pair of vertices v,w there could be
- An edge from v->w
- An edge from w->v
- Both
- Neither

The number of different pair of vertices is V(V-1)/2
=> the number of enumeration if there's no self-loop is 4 ^ (V(V-1)/2) = 2 ^ (V(V-1) = 2 ^ (V^2 - V)

If we also count self-loops, there are 2^V different set of self-loops that can be added to any loopless directed graph above

=> the total number of enumerations is 2 ^ (V^2 -V) * 2 ^ V = 2 ^ (V^2)
