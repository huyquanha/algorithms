Swapping the content of a and b
This is very efficient, because what you are actually swapping is not the content of the
arrays itself, but the references to the arrays
First a reference t is set to a
Then we point a to reference to b (t is now holding the reference to a's array)
Then we point b to what t is pointing (which is the content of a's array)
