When we insert keys in decreasing order, the next key is always smaller than all previous keys
=> will be inserted to the left bottom as a left-leaning red link

We will switch between
- doing nothing
- have double left-leaning red links and have to do a rotateRight() followed by flipColors() to pass
the red link to the parent
- At the parent, we might not need to do anything, or again, have to rotateRight() followed by flipColors().
