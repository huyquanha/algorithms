When you insert keys in order, you will continously introduce right-leaning red links, because
the next key is larger than all the previous keys so it will be inserted at the right bottom

When we balance this tree, we will see ourselves doing a rotateLeft() operation to left-lean
the right-leaning red link. After that, we will see ourselves doing a flipColors() operation (because
the right link (new) is red and the old left link is also left) => pass the red link up to the parent

At the parent, we continue doing rotateLeft() and flipColors() and pass the red link up.
