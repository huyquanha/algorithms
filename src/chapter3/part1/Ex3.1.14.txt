BinarySearchST is very slow when there's a lot of put() operations, because in case of a search miss,
the whole array after the intended position needs to be moved up to spare a space for the new insertion
=> 2N array accesses for each insertion in the worst case, wherease it is only N for SequentialSearchST

the get operation is N/2 on average for SequentialSearch and lgN for BinarySearch.

this is hard to call, but SequentialSearch may have an edge here.
