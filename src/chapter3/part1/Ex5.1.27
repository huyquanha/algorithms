Cost of building a symbol of table of N distinct keys
    - Inserting a new key into the a table of sie m uses ~2m array accesses in the worst case

=> the worst case of building a table will be 2(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... + N) ~ N^2

Cost of each search operation is ~lgN

=> the order of growth for S is N^2/lgN so the cost of all search operations equal the cost of building table
