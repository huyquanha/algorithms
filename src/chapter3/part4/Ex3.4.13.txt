a) With all keys hashing to the same index, they will form a continuous cluster of keys starting from that index onwards (might even wrap around),
with no null holes in between => expected linear running time to go through all the keys and compare with the input key

b) With each key hashing to a different indices, the running time is O(1), because a search hit means the input key is in the table,
and hashing the input key will give the exact index as where the key is in the table, without any additional probe, because the hash
doesn't collide with any other keys

c) This is exactly the same as a. The even doens't change anything

d) a Search hit would still find the key in O(1) (first probe) because all keys hash to different values
