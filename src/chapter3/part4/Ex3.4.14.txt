Search miss: the input key is not in the table

a) It could take linear running time if the hash of the input key collide with one of the keys in the cluster, but it could
also just take O(1) if the hash of the input key fall outside of the cluster (which will be null => done)
b) We can say nothing about this (no expected linear running time). If all the keys hash to different indices,
but they fill in the null holes and form a continuous cluster => can be linear. But if they are separated by null holes,
then you probably just need 1 or 2 probes to have a search miss
c) Same as a
d) constant time (1 or 2 probes) to get a search miss
