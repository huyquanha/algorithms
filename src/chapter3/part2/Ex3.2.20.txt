For each key in the BST that is in the range, we need one enqueue operation to put it in the queue
For each key that we exmanine, if the left or right subtree has the potential of being in the range,
we go down one level. In the worst case we go down h levels, with h being the tree height.

=> the running time is at most proportional to the tree height plus the number of keys in the range
