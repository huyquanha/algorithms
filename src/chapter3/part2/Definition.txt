- A node with no child is called 'leaf node' or 'external node'
- A non-leaf node (that has either one or both child nodes being non-null) is an 'internal node'

- Internal path length of the tree is henced defined as the total path lengths of all the internal nodes to the root
- External path length of the tree is defined as the total path lengths of all external nodes to the root

However, in the textbook, the "internal path length" is defined as the total path lengths of all nodes (including
leaf nodes) to the root. The "external path length", as a consequence, is defined as the total path lengths of all the
null links (children of leaf nodes) to the root.

- In-order traversal
    - Traverse the left subtree, call Inorder(left-subtree)
    - Visit the root
    - Traverse the right subtree, call Inorder(right-subtree)
    - Special: if the tree is a Binary Search Tree (BST), the nodes will be printed out in sorted order when doing this traversal

- Preorder traversal
    - Visit the root
    - Traverse the left subtree, call Preorder(left-subtree)
    - Traverse the right subtree, call Preorder(right-subtree)

- Postorder traversal
    - Traverse the left subtree, call Postorder(left-subtree)
    - Traverse the right subtree, call Postorder(right-subtree)
    - Visit the root


- Predecessor (in context of in-order traversal): The node immediately before a node when doing in-order traversal
- Successor (in context of in-order traversal): The node immediately after a node when doing in-order traversal
