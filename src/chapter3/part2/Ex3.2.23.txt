  A   B

    y

      C

Let's assume y = min(B)

- Delete x, then y
    - Delete x
        - t = x
        - x = min(B) = y
        - x.right = deleteMin(B)
        - x.left = t.left
                    y
                   / \
                  A   B
                     /
                    C

    - Delete y
         - t = y
         - y = min(B) = min(C) = z
         - y.right = deleteMin(B)
         - y left = A

- Delete y, then x
