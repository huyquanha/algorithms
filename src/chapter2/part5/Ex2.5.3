if a.amount - 0.005 <= b.amount <= a.amount + 0.005 then we conclude a = b (1)
if a.amount - 0.005 <= c.amount <= a.amount + 0.005 then we conclude a = c (2)

From (1) and (2) we can conclude that b = c (3)

However, if b. amount = a.amount - 0.005, and c.amount = a.amount + 0.005,
then b.amount < c.amount - 0.005 => b < c (4)

(3) and (4) conclicts since b cannot be both = c and < c

Fix: get rid of all the 0.005
