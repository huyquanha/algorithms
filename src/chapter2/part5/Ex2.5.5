Selection Sort continuously find the next minimum item and exchange it to the front of the array.
Imagine we have this array 5 4 1 4 2 3

first iteration: min is 1 => 1 4 5 4 2 3
second iteration: min is 2, exch with the first 4 => 1 2 5 4 4 3
As we can see, the first 4 is moved behind the second 4
next is 3, then 4, then 5, and at the end the first 4 is still behind the second 4.

In this example, the effect of unstable is not clear because we are sorting primitive type. But it will make
more senes if you think of the 2 4s as reference objects.
