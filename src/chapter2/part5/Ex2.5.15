We sort the list of emails by the domain names (splitting using the '@' delimiter), then compare the emails
by the part that is after the delimiter. This way, we group together emails that come from the same domain,
and we can send an email from a user of the same domain.

Bonus: based on the previous exercise (Ex2.5.14), it might even be more beneficial if we sort the domain
names using the reverse domain. For example: cs.princeton.edu and it.princeton.edu would appear very far
from each other by a normal sort, even though they are actually 2 subdomains of princeton.edu.
By sorting them by the reverse domain name, they would be very close to each other (edu.princeton.cs and
edu.princeton.it are almost similar).
