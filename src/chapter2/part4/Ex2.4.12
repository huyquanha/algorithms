- Heap
    - find the maximum: constant time
    - insert: ~lgN
    - remove maximum: ~lgN
- Unordered array
    - find the maximum: ~N
    - insert: constant
    - remove maximum: ~N
- Ordered array
    - find the maximum: constant
    - insert: ~N in the worst case
    - remove maximum: constant

Since finding the maximum dominates the number of operations, heap and ordered array are much better than unordered array
If the number of insert is larger than the number of remove maximum, I would recommend using Heap. If the number of
insert is smaller than the number of remove maximum, I would recomment using ordered array
