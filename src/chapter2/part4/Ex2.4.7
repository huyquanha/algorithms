With the assumption that all elements are distinct

- For k = 2, the second largest element must be in position 2 or 3. If it is in position 4 or 5, it can only be
the third largest element at most, because it will be smaller than the 1st, and the 2nd. Same for 6 or 7
- for k = 3, the third largest element must be in either 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7. Starting from 8, that element will be
smaller than the 1st, 2nd, and 4th element, so it cannot be the third largest element
    - Example:
        - position 2: 10 8 9 7 6 5 4 3 2 1...
        - position 3: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1...
        - position 4: 10 9 7 8 6 5 4 3 2 1...
        - position 5: 10 9 7 6 8 5 4 3 2 1...
        - position 6: 10 7 9 5 4 8 6 3 2 1...
        - position 7: 10 7 9 5 4 6 8 3 2 1...
- for k = 4, the fourth largest element must in the range from 2 -> 15. Starting from 16, that element will be
smaller than 1st, 2nd, 4th and 8th element, so it cannot be the fourth largest element
