Heap of size 31 => run from 1 to 31
30 and 31 is children of 15
- k = 2: the 2nd smallest is larger than only 1 element => its position can only be from 16 onwards.
the 15th is larger than 30th and 31th, so it must be at least the 3rd smallest item.
- k = 3: the 3rd smallest is larger than 2 elements => its position can only be from 8 onwards.
if its position is 7 or smaller, 7 is larger than 14 15, 14 and 15 in turn is larger than some others.
From position 8 onwards, it is larger than 16 and 17, and 16 and 17 does not have to be larger than any other elements
- k = 4: the 4th smallest is larger than 3 elements => its position can only be from 8 onwards. If it is 7, then it is larger
than 14, 15, which in turn are larger than 28, 29, 30, 31. When it is 8, it is larger than 16 and 17, does not have to be larger than
any more elements. Carefully arranging will result in the element being the 4th smallest item.
