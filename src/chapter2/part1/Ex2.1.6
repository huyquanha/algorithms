- Insertion sort is able to take adv of input. When all keys are identical, Insertion Sort would take only one compare
per each pass and no exchanges are necessary => ~N compares
- Selection sort is on the other hand input-agnostic, it performs the same no matter the input. Even if all keys are equal,
it will still have to go through each remaining element in the array to make sure it get the minimum => still ~ N^2/2 compares and
N exchanges

=> Insertion Sort is clearly the winner in this case
