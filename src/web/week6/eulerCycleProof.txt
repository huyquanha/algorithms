Show that a connected graph has an Eulerian cycle <=> every vertex has even degree

- If the graph has an Eulerian cycle => every vertex has even degree
    - By contradiction, suppose there is a vertex with odd degree in such graph. The cycle doesn't stop at any vertex so it has
    to go in and then out of every vertex => each time it passes a vertex it uses 2 of the vertex's adjacent edges
    => it's impossible to use each edge exactly once if the number of edges adjacent to a vertex is odd

- If every vertex has even degree => the graph has an Eulerian cycle (go through each edge exactly once)
    - Since each vertex has even degree, the cycle can use one edge to go in the vertex, and then use another edge
    to go out of the vertex, then in and out again,...since this is true for every vertex, it's guanranteed we always
    find a way to form a cycle that goes through every edge, each edge exactly once.
