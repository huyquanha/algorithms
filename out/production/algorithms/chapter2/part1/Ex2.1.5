- j > 0 condition always false when the loop terminate
N, N-1, N-2,...,3, 2, 1
Reason: for each element starting from the 2nd, since it is guaranteed to be smaller than all the elements to the left of it (the "sorted"
ones), it will be exchanged all the way to the left end of the array, so the loop terminates because j > 0 condition returns false

- less(a[j], a[j-1]) always false when the loop terminate
1, 2, 3, ..., N -1, N
Reason: for each elemenet starting from 2nd, since it is guaranteed to be larger than the element right next to the left, the loop
will terminate right from the first compare so less([aj], a[j-1]) always false
