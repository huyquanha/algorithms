We call 3 values a, b, c and without loss of gneralization, assume a < b < c
The sorted array would be a,a,a,..a,b,b,b,..b,c,c,c,..c

Since insertion sort struggles the most when the array is in reverse order, the worst case input might be something like
c,c,c,..c,b,b,b...,b,a,a,a...a
We call number of c C, number of b B, number of a A and A + B + C = N
To put each b before all the c, we need ~ B*C compares and exchanges
To put each a before b and c, we need ~ A * (B + C) compares and exchanges
=> total is B*C + A*(B+C)
If the array is randomly generated, A, B and C will all be ~ N/3
=> B*C + A*(B+C) = N^2/9 + N/3 * 2N/3 = N^2/9 + 2N^2/9 = N^2/3 => still quadratic in the worst case
