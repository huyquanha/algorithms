N, N -1, N-2,...,3, 2, 1
- Selection Sort
    - Number of exchanges: N
    - Number of compares: N-1 + N-2 + .... + 2 + 1 + 0 = (N-1)N/2

- Insertion Sort
    - Number of exchanges: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (N-2) + (N-1) = N(N-1)/2
    - Number of compares: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (N-2) + (N-1) = N(N-1)/2

It looks like for this particular array, selection sort performs better than insertion sort, due to a much smaller number of exchanges
