Our aim is to keep the top card as always being the smaller of the 2, and putting the other card to the bottom of the deck,
so say for the first pass, after 51 compares

2 3 A 5 4
2 A 5 4 3 (remember 3 as the first card pushed down)
A 5 4 3 2
A 4 3 2 5
A 3 2 5 4 (now we encounter 3 again => we have gone through the whole array) and A is the smallest card. put A to the bottom

Remember A as the smallest element encountered
3 2 5 4 A
2 5 4 A 3
2 4 A 3 5
2 A 3 5 4 (when we encounter A again, we know we've done the compare). Put 2 to bottom and then A to bottom

3 5 4 2 A (remember 2 as the second smallest)

3 4 2 A 5

3 2 A 5 4 (encouter 2 again => done). put 3, then 2, then A to bottom of deck. Remember 3 as the next smallest

5 4 3 2 A

4 3 2 A 5 (encounter 3 => done). put 4, 3 2, A to bottom

5 4 3 2 A (encounter 4 and 5 > 4 => done). The deck is not sorted from bottom to top

For N cards, this approach takes N - 1 compares for the first card, worst case N -1 exchanges (if it's the smallest item)
and N-1 pop top and push bottom. For the second card it's N -2, then N -3,....2,1 => ~ N^2/2 compares, exchanges and pop-push
