For a sorted array, every single call merge(a, lo, mid, hi) will be skipped because
a[mid] <= a[mid+1] always ( property of a sorted array). Hence, the only compare needed
is less(a[mid], a[mid+1]).
Working our ways backward, to merge 2 subarrays of size 1 we need 1 compare => N sub-array of size 1 results
in N/2 compares
To merge 2 subarray of size 2 we also need just 1 compare => N/2 sub array of size 2 needs N/4 compares
Similarly, N/4 sub array of size 4 needs N/2 compares.
...
2 sub array of size N/2 needs 1 compare. And we are done.

The total number of compares are: N/2 + N/4 + N/8 + ... + 2 + 1 = S
                                2S = N + N/2 + N/4 + ... + 4 + 2
                                => S = 2S - S = N + 1 => linear compares.
