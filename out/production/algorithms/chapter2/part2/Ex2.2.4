Yes because imagine if the sub-arrays are not in order, that means the elements pointed at by i and j
(the left pointer and the right pointer) respectively may not be the smallest elements encountered.
There might be a smaller element that a[i] after i in the left half, or there might be a smaller element
that a[j] after j in the right half, and the sorting result is no longer correct
