Prove: The expected number of compares >= ~ N lg N

The expected (or average) number of compares = total path lengths from the root to all leaves / number of leaves

In order for the expected number of compares to be minimized, the number of leaves must be maximized
The number of leaves is maximized when the tree is perfectly balanced
When the tree is perfectly balanced, the length of the path from root to any leave is the same and equals h (tree height)
We also have another property, which is: the number of leaves >= N!
For a perfectly balanced tree, the number of leaves = 2^h
=> 2^h >= N!
=> h >= lg N! ~ N lg N => the expected number of compares >= ~N lg N
