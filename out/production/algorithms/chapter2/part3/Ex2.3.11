With all arrays that have a constant number of distinct keys, very often we will encounter a key equal to the
partitioning item's key. If we scan over that key instead of stopping, the final crossing position will be
further away from the middle of the array (because the pointer is allowed to move much faster by not stopping
at  equal keys), and we all know the middle is the ideal, and further from the middle pushes the quicksort performance
from linearithmic to quadratic
