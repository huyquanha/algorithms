a[i] = C > v => exch(a, i, gt--) (the reason we don't increment i immediately because we don't know if the element
currently pointed at by gt is less than, equal or larger than v. It needs another examination. The reason we can increment i
immediately after exchanging with lt is because we know for sure the element pointed to by lt is equal to v)

while (i <= gt) still true, we continue
a[i] = A < v => exch(a, i++, lt++)
A A A A A A A B B B B B R D C
              lt      gt
                        i

now i > gt and the while loop breaks. We can see that we have put all the elements equal to v (B) in the middle,
with all elements smaller to v on the left and all elements larger than v on the right.
