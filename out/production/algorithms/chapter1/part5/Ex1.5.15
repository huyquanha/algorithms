With N = 1, only 1 level with 1 node => 1 => correct
With N = 2, 2 level with 1 node each => 1 1 => correct

When we union 2 trees with 2 nodes each, as for the worst case for weighted quick union,
we have to place one tree under another. If we place the levels horizontally, we have this

Tree1: 1 1
Tree2:   1 1 (tree 2 is placed under tree 1, so it's one level lower)
Result:1 2 1 => correct

Similarly, if we have Tree 3 with 4 elements (1 2 1) and tree 4 with 4 elements (1 2 1)
Tree3: 1 2 1
Tree4:   1 2 1
Result:1 3 3 1 => correct

We start to see that this forms a Pascal triangle and the number of nodes/level in the
resulting tree at every step for worst case weighted quick union is always going to be binomial coefficients.

-----------------
With N = 2 ^ n, the height of the tree is n with levels 1,2,3,...,n+1 or depth 0,1,2,,...,n
The average depth is (sigma(k=0 to n) (k * binomial(k)))/N

This looks complex, but actually it's just the sum, at depth k, of the (depth * number of nodes at that depth) for each depth,
then divide by the total number of nodes which is N
The number of nodes at each depth, like we just prove above, is a binomial coefficient of k

There's a formula that has been proven that the sigma sum equals n*2^(n-1) =>

the average depth is n*(2^(n-1))/2^n = n/2
