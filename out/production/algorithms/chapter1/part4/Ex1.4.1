if only 3 numbers, there's only 1 way to choose them
1 = 3 * (3-1) * (3-2)/6 => true for 3 numbers

say the theory is true for k numbers, that is the number of triples = k*(k-1)*(k-2)/6,
we prove it's also true for k+1 numbers

For k numbers, there are k(k-1)/2 different ways to choose a pair of numbers

=> for the next number, it will form k(k-1)/2 more triples

=> total number of triples for k+1 is
k(k-1)(k-2)/6 + k(k-1)/2 = (k(k-1)(k-2) + 3k(k-1))/6
                         = (k+1)k(k-1)/6
                         = K(K-1)(K-2)/6 with K being k+1

=> proof done
